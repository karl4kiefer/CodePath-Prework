## Favorite Applications and Features (Step 4)

### List of my favorite applications and the features I most like about them:

1. Spotify
   - Spotify's UI is simplistic and easy to use. At the bottom of the screen, it shows what you were listening to,
     along with having easy tabs all the way on the bottom of the screen for quick access to playlists, search, and home screens.
   - When you first open Spotify, it shows at the top of your screen your last listened to playlists, giving quick and eassy access to
     selecting songs.
   - Spotify does a great job at finding recommended songs for you, making finding new music easy.

2. Outlook
   - Outlook's design and UI is also simplistic, giving you access to the most used features quickly. Accessing my calendar along with
     composing new mail is literally a click of a button, making things fast and easy.
   - Outlook's focused tab lets me see the mail that's most important to me first, like emails from professors or the school. It does
     a great job at sorting mail and allows me to see what I need to see first.

3. Discord
   - One of my favorite things about discord is how customizable it is. Discord lets you group your servers into categories, move them
     to anywhere you'd like on the sidebar, and does so in an easy to navigate way.
   - Discord's activity monitoring is great for seeing what your friends are up to, listening to, or playing (if they choose to show those things).
   - Discord has great features for connecting with your friends. While in calls, discord allows the user to share their screen to friends, and does
     so in a customizable way, allowing the user to either share a certain tab, monitor, or just share it all. It's easy to use and has proven to be
     helpful to me multiple times.

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

  Before learning about CodePath, I was interested in iOS development and creation. I wanted to make an application for gardening, as I enjoy it a lot 
and felt that a lot of apps already out there either lacked features that would have been helpful for my needs or hid them behind a paywall, so I wanted
to create an application that had those features. Some of the features I had brainstormed were the ability to add your plants to the app, send out push 
notifications when watering was necessary, track the growth of the plants either by taking pictures to create a timelapse or by actually measuring, 
milestones for the growth of the plant and for motivation, a watch compatible app to be able to check things on your watch, and a few more that were much 
more advanced but something I hoped to achieve much later down the line, like built in AI and a plant database. Some of these features like adding your 
plants to the app are already a thing on lots of apps, but is crucial for building a plant app. This is an application I aspire to create by the end of my 
college journey and hope to add much more down the road.

## Notes

Some challenges that I faced along the way creating the application:

- Connecting the UI to logic posed a challenge at first, as navigating the UI and connecting the button to the ViewController was mildly confusing, but
  was rewarding when I figured it out and was a good experience.

Other than that, it was a relatively straightforward and informational experience.
